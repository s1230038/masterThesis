In recent years, Deep Q-learning (DQL) becomes more and more important to any field. Deep Q-learning, which is also one of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), is Q-learning with Deep Q Network (DQN). Before employing reinforcement learning for finance in earnest, the papers that applied machine learning tended to focus on predicting the future. The weakness in the predictive approach is to ignore the option to wait. Therefore, this thesis studies DQN for the retail foreign exchange trading (Forex, A.K.A. FX). The DQN utilizes multiple moving averages (MA) of the exchange rate history like USD/JPY as state element. Based on the results, this thesis presented two conclusions. Firstly, unfortunately, the agent failed to learn to get profit in both training and testing because MA may be invalid metrics for Forex trading. Secondly, reinforcement learning itself was presumed to help to avoid losses. Accordingly, further investigation is needed to make this DQN method practical.
